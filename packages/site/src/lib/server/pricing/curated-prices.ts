 * Seeds `CURATED_PRICES` (e.g. claude-opus-5-5, which prefix matching priced as
 * claude-opus-5 until a sync listed it) as builtin prices with source 'aiusage'.
 * A price is written only when no row exists for its key, or when the existing
 * row is one seeded here and the curated rate has changed; LiteLLM-synced and
 * admin-entered prices are never touched. Runs after the schema migrations on
 * every startup, so a deployment prices these models without an admin sync.
