/**
 * Seeds the curated aliases from `CURATED_PRICE_ALIASES` (e.g. gemini-3.1-pro →
 * gemini-3.1-pro-preview, issue #69) as builtin aliases. An alias is added only
 * when its target price exists, no price is registered under the alias name
 * itself (an alias would shadow it) and no alias of that name exists yet; an
 * alias seeded here is removed once a real price appears under its name and
 * follows the curated list when its target changes. Only rows with origin
 * 'builtin' and source 'aiusage' are touched (LiteLLM aliases carry source
 * 'litellm'). Runs after the schema migrations on every startup and at the end
 * of each LiteLLM pricing sync, so a deployment prices these models without
 * waiting for an admin sync.
